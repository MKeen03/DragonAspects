                    Malygos was the Aspect of the blue dragonflight and one of the most ancient creatures living on Azeroth and the eldest of the Aspects. Norgannon, the titan master-magician and keeper of lore, granted Malygos a portion of his vast power. From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-weaver, the guardian of arcane magic and hidden arcanum.

                    He was one of only a handful who were alive at the time the Titans departed. Malygos was a leviathan with small wings. His body was covered with crystalline scales of pure azure. His body shone with shifting colors that change constantly from blue to silver.

                    With lucidity restored to him, there were some - particularly the red dragonflight, and even members of his own - who did not like where his mind was going. Believing that the spellcasters of the mortal races were responsible for all of Azeroth's troubles, Malygos began a terrible war to purge the world of "rogue" magic users, including the Kirin Tor of Dalaran. Realizing the situation had grown out of hand, Alexstrasza rallied the remaining dragonflights in the Wyrmrest Accord to combat Malygos' genocidal crusade. After much conflict around the Nexus, heroes entered Malygos' inner sanctum and, with the aid of the red dragonflight, killed him, ending the war but depriving magic of its appointed guardian at a crucial point.

                    Malygos was the oldest of the five Aspects.Malygos was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. When he was younger, he and another proto-dragon named Tarys were especially close.

            While on a hunt in the wastes of Northrend, he met a proto-dragon named Alexstrasza who was searching for her lost brother. Proud of his intelligence, Malygos agreed to aid her in her search. The two were attacked by a savage gray proto-dragon, and though they fought it off Alexstrasza noted that it was frightened of something. Alexstrasza and Malygos would later find her brother, though he was a shriveled husk of flesh and bone.

        Later, Malygos and dozens of other proto-dragons of varying colors were hunting herds of grazing caribou. He watched as Alexstrasza helped her sick younger sister, Ysera, though Ysera refused to take the sympathy. A rival proto-dragon of Malygos' named Coros glared at him as he ate his own kill. Malygos also witnessed a brown proto-dragon predicting the herd's movements and snatching two at a time while others around him would only crash into the ground.
