                    Ysera is the former Dragon Aspect of the green dragonflight, charged with keeping watch over the flowering wilds of Azeroth from within the Emerald Dream. Bound to this ethereal realm, she descended into an endless trance and became known thereafter as the Dreamer. She would later fight off the Emerald Nightmare and the corruption of her children.

                    Ysera, now nicknamed the Awakened, recently awoke from her slumber within the Emerald Dream during the events of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, though she was not yet able to consistently tell the difference between dream and reality; while she was still sane, she was not yet entirely coherent.Ysera aided the Guardians of Hyjal when the Twilight's Hammer and other forces of Ragnaros attacked Mount Hyjal. She, along with her fellow Aspects, eventually gave up their titan-given power to stop their mad brother Deathwing during his last stand.

                    She continued to provide guidance and wisdom to all who revere nature, acting as mentor to the druids of Azeroth. Ysera was ultimately corrupted by the satyr Xavius and the Emerald Nightmare, and was, with much sadness, slain by Tyrande Whisperwind and the Cenarion Circle. Following her death, her spirit came to reside in Ardenweald within the Shadowlands, where in time the Winter Queen bound her to Ardenweald itself. Ysera is also the foster mother of the demigod Cenarius

                    Ysera was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of her kind. Born smaller than the average proto-drake, Ysera was sick and a yellowish color. She and her two siblings, Alexstrasza and Dralad, were the only survivors of their clutch. While someone as small as Ysera would have normally be killed soon after hatching, Alexstrasza took care of her little sister.

                On a day when dozens of proto-dragons gathered to hunt caribou, Ysera approached a blue-white proto-dragon named Malygos to ask him about her brother's corpse, which Malygos had found alongside Alexstrasza. She said that there was another corpse she and Alexstrasza had found, though Alexstrasza reprimanded her, saying they had agreed not to speak of that. The two argued, but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of Galakrond. After the gigantic terror had flown away, a confident grey proto-dragon named Neltharion taunted them all for being afraid.

            <p class="white-text medium-text para">
            Ysera and Alexstrasza would later come across the shriveled-up corpses of two proto-dragons, including Malygos's old companion Tarys. A small and terrified purple proto-dragon insisted that Galakrond had devoured the dead dragons, which matched theories Malygos had expressed to the two sisters. They went to fetch Malygos so he could meet the purple dragon. After his arrival, the corpses stirred and attacked as undead. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Ysera tore them apart.
