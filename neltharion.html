                    Deathwing the Destroyer, formerly known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder (pronounced "nehl-THAW-ree-uhn"), was one of the five Dragon Aspects and leader of the black dragonflight. Ages ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Pantheon with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients, eventually abandoning his title of Aspect of Earth in favor of being the Aspect of Death.Becoming one of the greatest terrors of the known world, his name too became one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt among both mortals and dragons. He was perhaps the most powerful servant of the Old Gods.

                    The black Aspect involved himself in the Second War, adopting the form of the human Lord Daval Prestor in order to destroy the Alliance from within. As a human, Prestor was said to be tall, with a slim figure, black hair and clean-shaven hawklike features that were the subject of gossip among the ladies of King Terenas' court. He also had a quick mind and a friendly, engaging manner that endeared him to all involved in the Alterac crisis. It was said that he even got a smile out of Genn Greymane, the normally dour king of Gilneas.

                    Deathwing also managed to turn his greatest enemy, Alexstrasza, into a slave of the Horde, with which he later allied himself. After a series of setbacks culminating in his defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, Deathwing retreated to Deepholm in the Elemental Plane to recuperate. From there, he observed his former mate Sintharia's experiments with the twilight dragonflight in Grim Batol, and later continued his late consort's work.

                    Though believed dead by many, Deathwing returned in spectacular fashion after the fall of the Lich King. Entering Azeroth through Deepholm fractured the World Pillar, causing the Elemental Plane to start collapsing onto Azeroth. This Cataclysm reshaped the entire world of Azeroth and unleashed widespread destruction. As the world reeled, he appeared and brought flame to various regions of Azeroth. His ultimate goal was to bring about the Hour of Twilight - the liberation of the Old Gods and the end of all life on the planet. Deathwing was aided by powerful allies also minions of his masters, such as the warped ogre-mage Cho'gall and his Twilight's Hammer cult, the powerful Elemental Lords Al'Akir and Ragnaros, and the Neferset tol'vir of Uldum.

                Uniting their powers, the remaining Dragon Aspects sent adventurers to brave the unstable paths of the Caverns of Time to retrieve the Dragon Soul, an ancient artifact crafted by Deathwing himself 10,000 years earlier and destroyed shortly after the Second War, for it was believed to be the only means of defeating him. With the weapon secured, the Aspects took the battle to their corrupted brother, with the orc shaman Thrall as the wielder of the Dragon Soul, now imbued with Deathwing's essence - the very essence of the earth itself. After the siege of Wyrmrest Temple and unleashing his most powerful minions, Deathwing took to the skies until he was blasted with the Dragon Soul into the Maelstrom. His body at last giving way to the corruption within, Deathwing made his final stand in the raging torrent of the Maelstrom, where he was at last destroyed by the combined powers of the Aspects and the Dragon Soul.
