                In Azeroth's ancient past, the Dragon Aspects were proto-dragons who stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, Galakrond.   
Alexstrasza, her brother Dralad, and her younger sister Ysera were the only three survivors of their clutch. Ysera was sick and smaller than average, and Alexstrasza watched out for her.

                <p class="white-text medium-text para">
Alexstrasza was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of her kind. When one of her clutch brothers went missing, Alexstrasza searched to find him and met with Malygos. The two were attacked by a savage gray proto-dragon, and though they fought it off Alexstrasza noted that it was frightened of something. Alexstrasza and Malygos would later find her brother, though he was a shriveled husk of flesh and bone.

                <p class="white-text medium-text para">
Some time later, dozens of proto-dragons hunted caribou, Alexstrasza and Ysera included. While Alexstrasza would offer Ysera her kills, Ysera declined. Ysera approached Malygos to ask him about her brother's corpse, which Malygos had found alongside Alexstrasza. She said that there was another corpse she and Alexstrasza had found, though Alexstrasza reprimanded her, saying they had agreed not to speak of that. The two argued, but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of Galakrond. After the gigantic terror had flown away, a confident grey proto-dragon named Neltharion taunted them all for being afraid.

Ysera and Alexstrasza would later come across the shriveled up corpses of two proto-dragons, including Malygos's old companion Tarys. A small and terrified purple proto-dragon insisted that Galakrond had devoured the dead dragons, which matched theories Malygos had expressed to the two sisters. They went to fetch Malygos so he could meet the purple dragon. After his arrival, the corpses stirred and attacked as undead. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Ysera tore them apart.

<p class="white-text medium-text para">
Like the other proto-dragons Alexstrasza would gather under the command of Talonixa. While her sister believed that peace could made with Galakrond and the not-living. Alexstrasza knew that fighting was the only option, however, she vowed to not fight like Talonixa.

Witnessing Coros's betrayal and subsequent devouring by Galakrond, Malygos would return to the others only to find Ysera and Talonixa in conflict over the fate of the bitten proto-dragons who had begun to act like Galakrond. Alexstrasza found herself agreeing with Talonixa over the issue. Seeming to agree with Ysera's desire for them to still live, Talonixa decreed that the bitten would have to be quarantined for the safety of everyone else. Alexstrasza watched the bitten dragons be herded into a canyon. She was shocked to see Talonixa collapse it and killing all those trapped inside.
Alexstrasza would then later save her sister from Galakrond, after Ysera tried to plead peace even as the proto-dragon army fought the not-living. As Galakrond began to fight the proto-dragon army, the Watcher Tyr used one of the not-living to catch the sister's attention.
