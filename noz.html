                    Nozdormu the Timeless One, aspect of the bronze dragonflight and guardian of time, is one of the former Dragon Aspects empowered by the titans to watch over Azeroth. He fought against the demons during the War of the Ancients. Following this intervention, he retreated into seclusion, immersing himself in his duties. He emerges only infrequently when events require his direct presence. He intervened in the defeat of Deathwing at the hands of Krasus and his allies, one of the few times he has been seen in the skies of Azeroth.

                        With the threat of the infinite dragonflight and the advent of the Shattering, Nozdormu found himself less able to ignore the needs of his fellow Aspects and their allies. After aiding in the defeat of Deathwing's abominable creation Chromatus and his own insane future self, the Aspect of Time joined his brother and sister Aspects in killing Deathwing once and for all, but at the cost of most of his power, becoming mortal.

                        In Azeroth's ancient past, the Dragon Aspects were proto-dragons who stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, Galakrond. Nozdormu was a dust-brown male who first met Malygos and Neltharion when he saved them from being devoured by Galakrond. He was contemplative and, like Malygos, seemed to be relatively intelligent even compared to other sentient proto-dragons.

                                  Like the other proto-dragons Nozdormu rallied under Talonixa by accepting her as alpha in order to deal with the threat of Galakrond and the not-living. During this time Nozdormu quickly became fast friends with Malygos, Neltharion, Alexstrasza, and Ysera. While not agreeing with all of Ysera's beliefs Nozdormu was rather stunned at Talonixa's deception of herding the bitten into a cave and then collapsing it on them, which eventually killed all the bitten who had begun to act like Galakrond.

                    Nozdormu later found himself as part of Talonixa's proto-dragon army that moved to combat Galakrond. Before the proto-dragon army engaged their enemy in battle Malygos devised a plan in which the army would fly higher in the air where Galakrond could not fly. Quickly informing Talonixa of his plan Malygos was relived that to note that she was considering it. However, hearing his sigh Talonixa took it as a sign of Malygos's satisfaction of her bowing to his wisdom and engaged Malygos in battle. While Nozdormu and Neltharion were quick to help Malygos, Talonixa was helped by her two lieutenants. Despite Nozdormu encouraging a retreat, Neltharion openly called for Malygos to fight Talonixa and became the new alpha an action which enraged Talonixa and brought more of her followers to join her, which caused the trio to flee high into the air.</p>
